\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{here} is a great need for interpretation of brain signals for both use in control of devices, for prosthetics, for example, or for disease diagnostics \cite{}. Sensor measurements include ...
Problem of neuron localization or distribution of currents
typical approaches
our approach: max dipole

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
I wish you the best of success.
